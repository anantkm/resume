  Hi, my name is Anant Mahale, and I am an aspiring PhD student in Computer Vision. I graduated from the University of New South Wales (UNSW) with a Masters Degree in Information Technology with Excellence in 2021
  
  A genuine interest in Computer Vision has compelled me to extend my horizons and supplement my Masters degree with further research and even higher education.
  
  My area of research primarily focuses on Computer Vision, Machine Learning and Software Engineering. A comprehensive list of projects related to these fields can be found at https://anantkm.github.io/masters/
  After studying Deep Learning and Computer Vision subjects, I had developed a keen interest in object detection and tracking in computer vision. This led me to attempt research on the same during my Masters. I am eager to explore and pursue my PhD in Computer Vision and related fields.
